# Getting Started 

Welcome to HackRU's front-end.  If you're on this branch, that means you're helping maintain/manage the front-end.

You're otherwise known as a MF'er.  Let's get MF'in started.

1.  After cloning in, get dependencies from package.json by running `npm install`
2.  Get nvm in your computer.  Use something like `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash`
3.  You should have .env in project root and config_resume.js somewhere in src, you'll have to obtain these separately
4.  Check things out by starting the server: `sh ec2-run.sh`
