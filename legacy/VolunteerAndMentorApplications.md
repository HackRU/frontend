# Mentor and Volunteer Applications


## Important Notice

There is existing front-end code that lays the beginning foundations of forms that would allow users to register as volunteers and mentors.
The volunteer form has a list of areas to volunteer in and a list of shifts.
The mentor form has a set of textareas to fill out w.r.t. skills and expertise and also has a list of shifts.

Currently, the LCS backend **does not support handling of this information.**  I suspect it will in the future, because otherwise Volunteer and Mentor Managmenet will forever use a separate method and means to recruit people ~~which is not really fuckin conducive~~ which is a decision out of our control.

But I leave this code because it would be nice for all directors to be able to see who is doing what and when and (re-)allocate manpower accordingly, e.g. Day-Of when they want to handle judging, Food when they need servers, and even to report on attendance metrics or volunteering hours.  There's a lot one could do in the future.

Not everything will be completed.  This will be documented properly later.
