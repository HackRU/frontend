		                      The HackRU app stores and processes personal data

				                          that you have provided to us, in order to provide

				                          process of removing software restrictions and limitations

				                          imposed by the official operating system of your device. It

				                          could make your phone vulnerable to

				                          HackRU will not take responsibility for.

				                          Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an

				                          active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or

				                          provided by your mobile network provider, but

				                          HackRU cannot take responsibility for the

				                          app not working at full functionality if you t have

				                          access to Wi-Fi, and you t have any of your data

				                          allowance left.

		                      If re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you

				                          should remember that your terms of the agreement with your

				                          mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you

				                          may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data

				                          for the duration of the connection while accessing the app,

				                          or other third party charges. In using the app, re

				                          accepting responsibility for any such charges, including

				                          roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home

				                          territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data

				                          roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on

				                          which re using the app, please be aware that we assume

				                          that you have received permission from the bill payer for

		                      Along the same lines, HackRU cannot always

				                          take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You

				                          need to make sure that your device stays charged
				                          runs out of battery and you t turn it on to avail the

				                          Service, HackRU cannot accept

				                          responsibility.

				                          ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do

				                          rely on third parties to provide information to us so that

				                          we can make it available to you.

				                          HackRU accepts no liability for any loss,

				                          direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying

				                          wholly on this functionality of the app.

				                        </p> <p>

		                      At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is

				                          currently available on iOS

				                          decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,

				                          and ll need to download the updates if you want to keep

				                          installed on your device. However, you promise to always
