                HackRU is a 24-hour hackathon at Rutgers University. We welcome
                hundreds of students to join us in building awesome software and
                hardware projects. Industry experts and mentors come from all
                over the country to create an environment that fosters an
                atmosphere of learning through tech talks and one-on-one
                guidance. We encourage beginner and advanced hackers alike to
                challenge themselves and expand their skills.
